# Storytelling Recipe

Use this recipe when the user wants a sequence, not a single asset. The goal is clear story beats and executable genmedia runs. Avoid generic inspiration copy, fake dialogue, and em dashes.

## Inputs to collect

Ask only when missing information affects execution.

- Format: ad, short film, music video, documentary, tutorial, social story.
- Duration and aspect ratio.
- Number of shots or allowed range.
- Main subject, character, product, or location.
- Continuity anchors: character, product, wardrobe, environment, color.
- Source media: first frame, reference image, product shot, audio track.
- Audio needs: narration, music, sound design, transcript, no audio.
- Preferred model or model family, quality, cost, speed, audio, or multi-shot tradeoffs.

## Genmedia workflow

1. Routed endpoints (see [fal-models-catalog/text-to-video](../../fal-models-catalog/references/text-to-video.md) and [image-to-video](../../fal-models-catalog/references/image-to-video.md)):

 ```bash
 genmedia models --endpoint_id bytedance/seedance-2.0/text-to-video --json
 genmedia models --endpoint_id bytedance/seedance-2.0/image-to-video --json
 genmedia models --endpoint_id bytedance/seedance-2.0/reference-to-video --json
 genmedia models --endpoint_id fal-ai/kling-video/v3/pro/text-to-video --json
 genmedia models --endpoint_id alibaba/happy-horse/text-to-video --json
 genmedia models --endpoint_id veed/fabric-1.0 --json
 ```

 Fallback discovery for unsupported sequence controls:

 ```bash
 genmedia models "first frame last frame video generation" --json
 genmedia docs "multi shot video generation" --json
 ```

2. Inspect schema before planning exact payloads.

 ```bash
 genmedia schema <endpoint_id> --json
 genmedia pricing <endpoint_id> --json
 ```

3. Upload references.

 ```bash
 genmedia upload ./first-frame.png --json
 genmedia upload ./character.png --json
 genmedia upload ./product.png --json
 genmedia upload ./voiceover.wav --json
 ```

4. Choose the sequence route:

 - **Highest quality video**: Seedance 2.0 endpoints first.
 - **Native multi-prompt**: when schema has shot arrays, prompt lists, or timeline fields.
 - **First/last frame**: controlled transitions between key frames.
 - **Image-to-video per shot**: maximum continuity from approved stills.
 - **Manual per-shot generation**: when the model only supports one prompt.
 - **Audio-first**: generate or upload audio, then plan visual shot lengths.
 - **Lip-sync or talking avatar**: Fabric 1.0 or Creatify Aurora (see [character-lipsync.md](character-lipsync.md)).

5. Run long jobs async and download every result with a unique template:

 ```bash
 genmedia run <endpoint_id> \
 --prompt "<shot or sequence prompt>" \
 --async \
 --json

 genmedia status <endpoint_id> <request_id> \
 --download "./outputs/story/{request_id}_{index}.{ext}" \
 --json
 ```

6. Return a shot table with endpoint, request id, prompt summary, local path, and continuity issues. Genmedia downloads clips; it does not replace a timeline editor unless the chosen model returns a complete stitched video.

## Shot planning

Plan every sequence as beats first:

1. **Hook**: immediate visual reason to keep watching.
2. **Setup**: who, what, where, and why it matters.
3. **Development**: movement, discovery, proof, or escalation.
4. **Turn**: reveal, transformation, result, or emotional change.
5. **Close**: final image, product memory, CTA-safe frame, or unresolved mood.

For each shot, write:

- Shot number and duration.
- Story purpose.
- Visual prompt.
- Continuity anchor.
- Input reference, if any.
- Genmedia endpoint.
- Expected output path.

## Prompt build order

```text
SHOT [number], [duration]:
[story purpose]. [subject and action]. [location and time]. [camera framing].
[camera movement]. [lighting and color]. [continuity anchor]. [transition or
relationship to previous shot].
```

Keep one shot to one clear action unless the selected model supports multi-shot or timeline prompting.

## Sequence shapes

### 15 second social ad

| Shot | Time | Purpose | Visual role |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | 0-2s | Hook | striking product or problem image |
| 2 | 2-6s | Context | product in use or character reaction |
| 3 | 6-11s | Proof | feature, texture, process, result |
| 4 | 11-15s | Close | memorable final frame with safe space |

### 30 second commercial

| Shot | Time | Purpose | Visual role |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | 0-3s | Hook | image that defines the world |
| 2 | 3-7s | Product or hero | show subject clearly |
| 3 | 7-13s | Benefit | action, feature, transformation |
| 4 | 13-20s | Lifestyle or proof | real context, emotion, result |
| 5 | 20-27s | Escalation | strongest beauty or motion shot |
| 6 | 27-30s | End frame | clean brand-safe final composition |

### Short cinematic scene

| Shot | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| Establishing | where the scene happens and mood |
| Character reveal | who matters |
| Action beat | what changes |
| Reaction | emotional consequence |
| Detail insert | object, clue, texture, proof |
| Resolution | new state or unanswered tension |

## Continuity anchors

### Character anchor

```text
same character face, hair, wardrobe, age, posture, and style as the approved
reference
```

### Product anchor

```text
same product shape, color, packaging, logo placement, and material as the
reference
```

### Location anchor

```text
same room layout, window direction, color palette, and time of day
```

### Motion anchor

```text
single continuous shot, starts where previous shot ended, no time jump
```

### Pacing guidance

- **Fast**: 1-3 second shots, strong motion, clear graphic frames.
- **Medium**: 3-6 second shots, product demos, lifestyle, dialogue-like scenes.
- **Slow**: 6-10 second shots, luxury, drama, architecture, atmosphere.
- **Variable**: fast hook, slower proof, strong final frame.

## Workflows

### Native multi-prompt sequence

Use only when schema supports multiple prompts, shot arrays, scenes, timeline, or keyframe-like fields.

1. Inspect schema and identify the exact multi-shot fields.
2. Convert the story into concise shot prompts.
3. Keep one continuity anchor outside the repeated shot details if schema supports a global prompt.
4. Run async and download the completed result.
5. Check whether the model returned one video or per-shot files.

### Manual per-shot video

Use when the model supports only one shot at a time.

1. Create a shot table.
2. Generate or upload a reference frame for each shot.
3. Run each shot with unique download templates.
4. Record endpoint, request id, prompt, local output path, and defects.
5. Return clips in timeline order. Do not claim they are stitched unless they actually are.

### First-frame to last-frame

1. Generate or choose the opening frame.
2. Generate or choose the target final frame.
3. Upload both frames if local.
4. Inspect schema for accepted first/last frame fields.
5. Prompt the transition as one physical motion or transformation.
6. Run async and download.

### Character narrative

1. Use [character-design.md](character-design.md) to create or confirm the anchor.
2. Build shot variables around action, expression, and location.
3. Use image-to-video from approved stills when identity drift matters.
4. Compare each result to the anchor before advancing.

### Product narrative

1. Use [commercial.md](commercial.md) to define product invariants.
2. Plan the sequence around hook, feature, context, proof, final frame.
3. Use the same product reference for every shot if schema allows it.
4. Keep motion modest when packaging fidelity matters.

### Audio narrative

1. Search for narration, music, or sound generation models.
2. Inspect schema and run audio jobs with `--download`.
3. Use transcript or beat timing to set shot durations.
4. Return audio path and visual clip paths separately unless a model produces combined audio-video output.

## Examples

### 15 second coffee social ad

| Shot | Duration | Prompt |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | 2s | macro close-up of espresso crema swirling in a glass cup, warm morning window light, shallow focus, immediate sensory hook |
| 2 | 4s | same coffee cup placed beside a small bag of beans on a clean kitchen counter, slow push-in, product and texture readable |
| 3 | 5s | hand pours milk into the coffee, soft cloud bloom, controlled motion, warm lifestyle lighting, no text |
| 4 | 4s | final hero frame of cup and beans with clean negative space on right for copy, calm premium breakfast mood |

Generate still or video per shot unless the selected endpoint supports a prompt list.

### 30 second architecture brand film

| Shot | Duration | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | 4s | dawn exterior of a modern house, wide static frame, warm interior lights |
| 2 | 5s | slow tracking shot along concrete wall and timber detail, tactile proof |
| 3 | 5s | architect's hand sketches over plan, natural desk light, human process |
| 4 | 6s | family crosses the living room, soft backlight, space feels livable |
| 5 | 6s | crane up from courtyard to roofline, shows scale and geometry |
| 6 | 4s | quiet final exterior with empty safe space for brand mark |

Continuity anchor:

```text
same house, same material palette of warm timber, pale concrete, black steel
frames, and soft morning light
```

### Cinematic reunion scene

| Shot | Duration | Prompt |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | 5s | empty train platform in blue hour rain, wide locked-off frame, practical lights reflected on wet ground |
| 2 | 4s | close-up of woman noticing someone off screen, same coat and hairstyle, soft backlight, restrained emotion |
| 3 | 4s | medium shot of man stepping from train doorway, matching eyeline, cool station light |
| 4 | 5s | slow tracking two-shot as they walk toward each other, shallow depth of field, no crowd distraction |
| 5 | 6s | close hands meeting, rain on sleeves, quiet emotional detail |
| 6 | 6s | wide final frame of both under station clock, warm practical light, unresolved calm |

### Product launch sequence

```text
SHOT 1, 3s:
black screen opens to a thin rim light tracing the product silhouette, centered
macro frame, premium suspense, no text.

SHOT 2, 4s:
slow orbit reveals the product material and main contour, controlled studio
reflections, same product shape and logo placement as the reference.

SHOT 3, 5s:
close-up of the key feature in use, clean hand interaction, product remains
sharp, no fake labels.

SHOT 4, 3s:
final hero composition on simple surface with large negative space for copy,
brand-safe end frame, no generated text.
```

## Quality bar

Before returning:

- Shot order has a clear narrative function.
- The first shot is strong enough for the platform.
- Continuity anchors are repeated without bloating every prompt.
- Camera motion is varied but not random.
- Durations add up to the requested runtime.
- Async request IDs and downloaded files are recorded.
- The model's actual schema, not assumptions, drove the final command.
