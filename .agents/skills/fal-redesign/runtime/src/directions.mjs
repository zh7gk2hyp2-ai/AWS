    label: "Artistic Universal",
    vibe: "A considered, timeless, pushed redesign. PRESERVE the copy verbatim and the information architecture (nav items, section order, CTAs keep their meaning). Everything else is open. The final site should feel visibly transformed from the original: not the same layout re-skinned: with a distinct visual point of view that comes from the content itself. You are free on every other axis. If the brand and the content call for large photography, generate and commit to it. If they call for pure typography on an empty canvas, commit to that too. If a single graphic mark, a textural treatment, a diagram, a hand-drawn illustration, an oversized pulled numeral, a captioned marginalia, a framing device, or nothing at all is what the brand needs, go there. Make the call based on what serves the content: never because imagery is trendy, never because minimalism is trendy. Actively seek diversity: the goal is that no two redesigns from this direction look alike. Avoid defaulting to the same moves on every site (same hero scale, same numbered list, same cream-and-ink palette, same monochrome grid). Challenge yourself to find the move this particular brand deserves: and push it further than a safe corporate redesign would dare. Palette is restrained and brand-specific (two or three hues, one accent, never generic SaaS-vibrant). Typography is chosen because it serves the brand, not because it is the current trend. Craft is non-negotiable: 1px hairlines, deliberate baselines, real punctuation, correct number alignment. The final output should read as if a small thoughtful studio redesigned not just the page but the entire visual system around this brand's specific meaning: confident, coherent, unmistakably different from a generic template, and yet always in service of the content.",
